# JavaScript
-  JavaScript was initially created to make web pages alive.
- JavaScript can execute both in the browser as well as in the server.(Any platform that has the JavaScript Engine).


## JavaScript Fundamentals
- Hello, world
- Code Structure
- The modern mode, "use strict"
- variables
- Data types
- Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm
- Type conversions
- Basic operators, maths
- Comparisons
- Conditional branching: if, '?'
- Logical operators
- Nullish coalescing operator '??'
- Loops: while and for
- The "switch" statement
- Functions
- Function expressions
- Arrow functions, the basics
- JavaScript specials

## Data types
We can put any type in a variable. Programming languages that allow such things are called "Dynamically typed" meaning that there exist datat types, but variables are not bound to any of them.
- Number - Both Integers and floating points numbers. Operations(multiplication, *, division , /, addition, +, subtraction , -, ...)
- String - 
- BigInt - A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer. eg let number = 766666677888865555455667778888888888888888889987776655444433n;
- Boolean(logic type)
- null - Value does not belong to any of the types described.
- undefined - Value not assigned
- Objects & Symbols


- typeof  operator allos us to see which type is stored in a variable.
